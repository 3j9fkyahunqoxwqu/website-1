      .details
        p You need to download something like 50 PDFs from a site. That easily could be the first (and last) task for the day. Not so funny.
        p DownThemAll! scans all the links on a webpage, and lets you filter and download just the stuff you actually want, in a click. You can also download whole ranges of files: just tell DownThemAll! where to start and end. So easy.

      h2 Never lose a file again
      h3 Renaming and organizing downloads has never been easier.

      .details
        p Let's be honest. Your downloads folder is a terrible aggregate of random files. Finding a specific thing there is just plain mad.
        p DownThemAll! is able to automatically rename your files based on download date, file extension and many other useful properties, including creating subfolders for you.
